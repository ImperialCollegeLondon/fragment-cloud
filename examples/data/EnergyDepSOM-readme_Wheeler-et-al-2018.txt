Supplemental Online Material DescriptionTabulated energy deposition curves for the Chelyabinsk, Benesov, Kosice, and Tagish Lake meteors, as published in Wheeler et al. (2018).The text file for each meteor contains tab-delimited columns of energy deposition curve data in the following order: (1) altitude in kilometers, (2) nominal energy deposition estimate in kilotons per kilometer, (3) lower-bound energy deposition estimate in kilotons per kilometer, (4) upper-bound energy deposition estimate in kilotons per kilometer.File: ChelyabinskEnergyDep_Wheeler-et-al-2018.txtThe nominal Chelyabinsk energy deposition curve was obtained from Brown et al. (2013), which was derived from the light curve assuming 17% luminous efficiency, and the lower and upper bounds were estimated assuming luminous efficiencies of 21% and 13% respectively.File: TagishLakeEnergyDep_Wheeler-et-al-2018.txtThe Tagish Lake energy deposition curve was derived from the meteor light curve published by Brown et al. (2002). The nominal energy deposition curve assumed an initial mass of 56,000 kg and a luminous efficiency of 16%, and the lower and upper bounds were estimated assuming luminous efficiencies of 20% and 5% respectively.File: KosiceEnergyDep_Wheeler-et-al-2018.txtThe Kosice energy deposition curve was derived from the meteor light curve published by Borovicka et al. (2013), assuming that a zero-magnitude meteor radiates 1,530 W in the detector passband and that the meteor had an average luminous efficiency of 2.8%. The nominal energy deposition curve assumed an initial mass of 3,500 kg, and the upper and lower bounds assumed a factor-of-three mass uncertainty (1,170-10,500 kg).File: BenesovEnergyDep_Wheeler-et-al-2018.txtThe Benesov energy deposition curve was derived from the meteor light curve published by Borovicka et al. (1998) and Ceplecha & ReVelle (2005), assuming that a zero-magnitude meteor radiates 1,530 W in the detector passband and that the meteor had an average luminous efficiency of 6.1%. The nominal energy deposition curve assumed an initial mass of 4,100 kg, and the upper and lower bounds assumed a factor-of-two mass uncertainty (2,050-8,200 kg).References:Wheeler, L.F., Mathias, D.L., Stokan, E., Brown, P.G., 2018.
